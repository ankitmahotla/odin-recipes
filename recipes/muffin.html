    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Leftover cranberry sauce is obviously great on turkey sandwiches, and it's
      even delicious warmed up and spooned over ice cream or pancakes, but have
      you tried it in muffins? This easy recipe for cranberry muffins uses a cup
      of your smooth or chunky leftover cranberry sauce. The batter comes
      together in minutes and the moist, sweet muffins are perfect for a
      post-Thanksgiving breakfast or snack.

    <h2>Cranberry Sauce Muffins Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Flour: Two cups of all-purpose flour give these leftover cranberry sauce
        muffins structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sugar: Use a combination of white and brown sugar for ultimate
        sweetness.
      </li>
      <li>
        Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it makes
        the batter rise and creates a fluffy texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spices and flavorings: These cozy muffins are flavored with cinnamon,
        cardamom, a pinch of salt, and vanilla extract.
      </li>
      <li>
        Leftover cranberry sauce: You can use homemade or store-bought cranberry
        sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Milk: Any milk you have on hand is fine, from regular whole milk to your
        favorite alternative milk. Some reviewers suggest substituting orange
        juice.
      </li>
      <li>Oil: Vegetable oil adds moisture without imparting any flavor.</li>
      <li>Egg: One whole egg adds structure, richness, and moisture.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Make Cranberry Sauce Muffins</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Mix the wet ingredients: Beat the cranberry sauce, milk, oil, egg, and
        vanilla until well-combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix the dry ingredients: Mix the remaining ingredients in a separate
        bowl, then slowly incorporate the dry mixture into the wet mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the muffins: Pour the batter into lined muffin cups and bake in a
        preheated oven until the muffins are golden brown.
